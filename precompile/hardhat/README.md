# Precompile Hardhat Tasks

## Networks
Hardhat is configured with two supported networks:
* `localhost` for connecting to local dev net (localnet-docker, localnet-bin).
* `mezo_testnet` for connecting to the public testnet.

## Accounts
Hardhat [vars](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables) are used for configuring
accounts/keys.

```
WARNING

Configuration variables are stored in plain text on your disk. Avoid using this feature for data you wouldnâ€™t
normally save in an unencrypted file. Run npx hardhat vars path to find the storage's file location.
```

You can determine what `vars` are available by running:
```
npx hardhat vars setup
``` 

The vars can be set to either a) a single private key, or b) a comma separated list (no whitespace) of private keys.

```
npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

And can be removed with:

```
npx hardhat vars delete MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

## Scripts
Some helper scripts are included for convenience. It is recommended to run these scripts using `hardhat run` as they
may not execute as expected if running directly with node.

### accounts
Lists available accounts.

```
npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/accounts.ts
```

### localhost-keys
Reads seed phrases from `build` dir used by localhost based localnets and prints a comma separated list of private
keys.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/localhost-keys.ts
```

This output can be used to easily set `MEZO_ACCOUNTS` for `localhost` use.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/localhost-keys.ts | npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

## Tasks
We name Hardhat [Tasks](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/create-task) with a precompile prefix. This
provides clarity on which precompile the task runs against, and keeps the output of `npx hardhat help` clean as
precompile tasks get grouped together. You can view the available tasks with:

```
npx hardhat help
```

_Note: The default Hardhat tasks are still visible (e.g `compile`), many of these will do nothing as we are only using
Hardhat for tasks/testing._

Help information for a specific task can be obtained using

```
npx hardhat help <TASK>
```

e.g:

```
npx hardhat help validatorPool:submitApplication
